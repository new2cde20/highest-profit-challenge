# highest-profit-challenge

I tried to complete the highest profit challenge. Unfortunately, I had a hard time completing this challenge and was unsuccessful in finishing all of the requirements. I got stuck after being able to print my first answer, so I did not move forward with the other steps of the challenge.

I had worked on this for more than 3 hours and since I dedicated so much time to it, I didn't want to switch languages (I wrote my code in Java). I did get help from the following website to help me create the first part of my code: https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples/count-lines-in-file

I also had issues running my batch file and my code in my terminal. I spent much time troubleshooting but was not able to figure out why I could only run my code in my IDE (IntelliJ) but not in PowerShell/my terminal or through my batch file. I made sure my environment and system PATH variables were set to the correct location of the Java version I was running but unfortunately, I still couldn't figure out what was wrong.

Completing this challenge allowed me to learn something new. I've never created a batch script/file before so I was a little intimidated when I read that I had to execute my Java program using that, but once I googled for information (which I got from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6147613/creating-a-batch-file-for-simple-javac-and-java-command-execution/6147686#6147686 ) it was a simple process.

This code is able to produce the number of rows within the CSV file provided. I also included comments in my code to explain how certain lines worked to get the desired output. I tried to complete the next step by adding an if...else statement within my while loop, but was not able to get the correct output for the rows that did not contain only the rows with numbers in the Profit column, so I removed it. It was causing errors in my code and I wanted to be able to at least get some output for this program.

I also viewed several other sources to try to help me complete the last step of part 1. These were:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45101192/how-to-read-specific-columns-in-csv-file-java
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28354410/read-only-numbers-from-scanner
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6091736/java-text-input-how-to-ignore-lines-starting-with-certain-characters-in-them

I appreciate being given the chance to complete this coding challenge, even though I was unsuccessful in completing all of the requirements. It allowed me to learn something new and to see where I can improve in my coding practices.
